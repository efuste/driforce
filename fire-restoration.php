          		<h1>Dri-Force Fire Restoration</h1>
          		<p>Although fire trucks have left the scene the dangers of the fire remain. During the fire volatile vapors and soot residues are transferred by rising and expanding air, as well as air conditioning units, accumulating on structural surfaces and contents. Immediate response by a professional restoration company, Dri-Force Restoration, is crucial in order to return your property to a safe, and pre-loss condition. Pro-longed neutralization, cleaning, and corrosion control leads to higher restoration cost as well as escalating cost of damages. Combustion releases harmful toxins into the environment capable of aggravating respiratory illness, or other medical conditions. The following are the effects of soot and smoke within a property over time:</p>
          		<h2>The following are the effects of soot and smoke within a property over time:</h2>
